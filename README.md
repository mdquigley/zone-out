Final project for Java Music Systems with Professor Nick Didkovsky, Zone Out is a java program that creates generative ambient music for three voices, written with JMSL and JSyn. Below is an excerpt recording. It was originally hosted as a java applet on a personal website. I plan to recreate and expand on this idea with Javascript using Tone.js as a personal project sometime soon.
